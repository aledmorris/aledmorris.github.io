Welcome to my site, I'm happy that you have taken the time to view my content. Originally from Swansea, Wales, I have been living in Melbourne, Australia, since early 2012. I love technology and consider myself very lucky to have been born at the start of the 80's to experience the digital revolution.

# Professional Life

A Technical Trainer (APAC) working for a wonderful company, [Pexip](https://www.pexip.com), a video communications company offering self-hosted and cloud based (as-a-service) options for secure enterprise video conferencing. The technology is exceptional and I have learned so much by being part of it. In 2019, I joined the company as a Support Engineer for APAC focusing on the self-hosted product, Pexip Infinity. Late 2021, I moved into the training role, having been an unoffical trainer for the previous 6 months.

I had some scripting experience before joining and found that being immersed in our R&D environment has inspired me to be more curious and now have expanded my knowledge greatly. The Pexip product has become a great vehicle for me to apply skills that I am contantly gaining. Some of the things I enjoy are:

* Docker
* Python
* APIs
* Cloud
* Serverless apps

# Personal Life

I am a family man who enjoys watching sports (Rugby Union, Australian Rules Football, MMA) and enjoy running to keep myself relatively healthy. I have also been known to do a bit of woodworking and DIY, and a chunk of my time is lost watching TV shows or learning new things via YouTube (mostly coding stuff).
